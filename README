**********
Fork of official Putty svn repository as of December 1, 2014.
**********

Only tested on Windows.  There are better options than Putty
on the other platforms anyway.

Added features:

   - Option to generate Termkey codes for extended keyboard
   keys.  See:  http://www.leonerd.org.uk/hacks/fixterms
   A decent terminfo entry hasn't yet been included here.

   - mkfiles.pl will create a Makefile.mx for cross compiling
   a Windows exe from Linux (tested on Fedora).

   - Will recognize control codes sent by Tmux et al, to change
   the cursor color. Select color is "\E]12;<COLOR>\007" and
   to reset the cursor to its original color "\E]112\007". Most
   standard X11 color names are recognized (Red,Cyan,etc).

   - Will recognize control codes to change cursor shape.  The
     escape sequence is "\E[<STYLE> q" Where style is a single
     digit number meaning:
       0   - whatever style user has set in putty config
       1/2 - blinking/steady block
       3/4 - blinking/steady underline
       5/6 - blinking/steady vertical bar

   - Updates the Windows clipboard based on xterm codes sent
   by Tmux.  Clipboard start is "\E]52;;", and stop is "\007".
   The double semicolon matches the Tmux default. The data must
   be UTF-8 characters that have been Base64 encoded.

   - Support Italic font rendering. Begin italic mode "\E[3m",
   and end italics is "\E[23m".

   - Print-to-clipboard option in the settings->terminal tab.
   When configured this way, whatever data is sent between "print"
   control codes, to be copied to the Windows clipboard instead
   of a printer.  Print start is "\E[5i", and stop is "\E[4i".

Tmux has default terminal overrides to enable cursor color and
clipboard copy as long as the terminal name starts with "xterm".
So, set your "Terminal-type string" in Putty's config to "xterm"
or "xterm-256color".  If you do, Tmux currently sets these
default terminal-overrides:

	:XT:Ms=\\E]52;%p1%s;%p2%s\\007:
	:Cs=\\E]12;%p1%s\\007:Cr=\\E]112\\007:
	:Ss=\\E[%p1%d q:Se=\\E[2 q:
